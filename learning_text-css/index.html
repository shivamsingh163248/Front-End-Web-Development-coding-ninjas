        As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have access to specific and up-to-date information about
        the signature used in email communications by Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University (VBSPU), Jaunpur, or any
        other organization. Email signatures can vary based on individual preferences and organizational policies.

        If you are looking for the official email signature or format used by VBSPU, I recommend reaching out directly
        to the university's official communication channels. You can contact the university's administration, IT
        department, or public relations office to inquire about the standard email signature format used by the
        university.

        Please note that email signature information is subject to change, and it's best to obtain the most accurate and
        current details directly from the official sources at VBSPU. Visit the official website or contact the relevant
        university department for the most up-to-date information.
